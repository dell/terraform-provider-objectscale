type IamServiceListRolesResponseResult struct {
	// A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request  using the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results even when  there are more results available. We recommend that you check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.
	IsTruncated *bool `json:"IsTruncated,omitempty"`
	// When IsTruncated is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
	Marker *string  `json:"Marker,omitempty"`
	Member []string `json:"member,omitempty"`
