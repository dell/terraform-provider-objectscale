## Schema

### Required

- `endpoint` (String) The API endpoint, ex. https://10.225.100.1:4443
- `insecure` (Boolean) whether to skip SSL validation
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password
- `username` (String) The username

## Best Practices
1. The parent resource attributes of a certain resource can only be designated at creation.
   Once designated, they cannot be modified except for parent resource renaming.
2. The name of a resource is modifiable, but it is necessary to make sure its name referenced in the child resources
   is also updated (can be done manually or use reference resource_id.name).
3. Resources with child resources cannot be deleted independently. Use terraform destroy to delete all resources directly
   or delete all the child resources at the same time (depends_on is recommended to manage resources, serving as a
   precheck for delete operations).
