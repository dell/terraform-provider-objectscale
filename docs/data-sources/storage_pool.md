## Schema

### Optional

- `id` (String) Identifier of the Storage Pool to be fetched. Conflicts with `vdc_id` and `name`.
- `name` (String) Name of the Storage Pool to be fetched. This is an offline filter. Conflicts with `id`.
- `vdc_id` (String) ID of Virtual Datacenters from which Storage Pool(s) are to be fetched. If none given, the local VDC is used. Conflicts with `id`.

### Read-Only

- `storage_pools` (Attributes List) List of Storage Pools fetched using this datasource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--storage_pools))

<a id="nestedatt--storage_pools"></a>
### Nested Schema for `storage_pools`

- `description` (String) Description
- `drive_technology` (String) Drive technology of VArray
- `error_alert_at` (Number) Threshold percent at which error alert is raised.  Valid values are from -1 to 100. Value of -1 means do not alert
- `id` (String) Storage pool id
- `is_cold_storage_enabled` (Boolean) Flag indicating that cold storage encoding is enabled
- `label` (String) Lbel of VArray
- `name` (String) Storage pool name
- `number_of_code_blocks` (Number) Number of Code Blocks in EC Scheme
- `number_of_data_blocks` (Number) Number of Data Blocks in EC Scheme
- `status` (Number) flag for status, -1 for null, 0 ~ 6 for value
